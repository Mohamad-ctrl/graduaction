// This is a basic Flutter widget test.

// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

// Import the correct package name

    // This is a placeholder test file that can be properly implemented later
